= PURPOSE =

This project is meant to give an introduction to computer science (and maybe beyond). However, I don't intend to reinvent the wheel. This means that if someone already has written good documentation, I will link to it. This also means that a large part of the work is already done. What I haven't seen is a resource that takes the plethora of introductory information and puts it in one place. I intend to cover theory more than any one language, architecture, or software (I don't care if you think one thing is better than something else).

I am starting this document with text I sent someone about learning javascript - this may not be the the best language to convey some theories but it's a starting point. Also, I'm using this to learn MediaWiki formatting, so please excuse the abrupt commit messages as I go through this process.

= Intro =

If you go through these tutorials and don't write any code, your return on inventment is liable to be quite small (or none at all). The best advise is (as is stated in many IRC conversations) TIAS - Try It And See. If you are afraid your code won't work and haven't tried it because of that fear, you're doomed. When you are presented with code examples, start trying them. Fail alot and learn alot.

= Intro to programming =

Some video tutorials to start with:<br/>

* Basic Javascript:
http://www.w3.org/wiki/Programming_-_the_real_basics<br/>

* This MIT OpenCourseWare class was recommended (and seems to be pretty good). It uses Python and introduces lots of fundamental consepts quite nicely:
http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-00-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-fall-2008/video-lectures/<br/>

* Douglas Crockford has done some really good talks on js. He goes through computer history, into programming languages, and then onto javascript. This is a very informative introduction:<br/>
http://yuiblog.com/crockford/<br/>

== Misc (for now) ==

* The IBM AJAX series of articles:<br/>
http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/web/library/wa-ajaxintro1/index.html<br/>

Firebug<br/>
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/firebug/<br/>

3rd party plugins for JQuery:<br/>
http://jqueryui.com/<br/>

Node.JS<br/>
http://nodejs.org/<br/>

A very nice and simple web templating language:<br/>
http://handlebarsjs.com/<br/>

General JQuery tutorials:<br/>
* http://jqfundamentals.com/<br/>
* http://tutsplus.com/lesson/hello-jquery/<br/>

It is recommended that you should start out with Javascript in the browser and use Firebug and not Node.JS. That said, another good set of tutorials (centered around Node.JS and server-side libraries) is:<br/>
http://nodetuts.com/<br/>

This is somewhat more advanced but JS has very few rules, so you will probably get reading this pretty soon):<br/>
http://robertnyman.com/2008/10/21/javascript-inheritance-experimenting-with-syntax-alternatives-and-private-variables/<br/>

Alternatives - jquery isn't the only library around. You might want to look at these other libraries and see if you prefer something over jquery:<br/>
* MooTools:<br/>
http://mootools.net/<br/>

* Prototype - looks Perl-ish, but does some evilness (messing with the object.prototype):<br/> 
http://prototypejs.org/<br/>

* YUI - this does some very cool things (seems to beautify pages too) but it is slow and doesn't have the amount of people using it as jquery does:<br/>
http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/<br/>

= Help and Community =
TODO: make this section clearer and split things out.

You might want to look for mailing lists. I don't think there's a jquery users mailing list anymore. However there are JQuery people on IRC (spend a few hours, learn and get on irc - the time you spend figuring out this system will pay off in the help you get in the long run). there's a #javascript channel, #jquery, #jquery-ui, etc - some of those people are smarter and/or more knowledgeable than me and will help (just make sure you google before you ask). look at the plethora of technical technical web forums out there (stackoverflow, and others get enough traffic that you'll generally get someone with a useful answer). learn to love github (there have some days that i go no where else) - there are tons of projects here, and with them comes tons of documentation and examples.

= An Editor =

you might not understand until you get into this more - find a text editor you can live with (i use vim but don't know that i can recommend it for starting out). but, there's notepad++ (win), textmate (mac), coda (mac),.... or shit, just go with a link:
http://lifehacker.com/385929/best-text-editors or google 'best text editor'. also, you might eventually find a liking for emacs (as i have for vi / vim) however, i wouldn't start out with it - i think of emacs as an operating system with editor features, you don't want to be learning this at the same time as everything else.

o'reilly also has *algorithms books (c algorithms, perl algorithms, .net algorithms, etc) that are good coffee table books. ie, i wouldn't read them cover to cover but are cool to flip through. there's also the k&r c book:<br/>
http://www.amazon.com/C-Programming-Language-2nd-Edition/dp/0131103628<br/>
(don't buy this, go to the library and check it out - every library should have at least one copy of this book)<br/>


== Links ==
FWIW, here are my js bookmarks (again lots of server side js which might not be as useful to doing browser stuff, and lots of those links are above too):<br/>
